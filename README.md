Alignment of dynamic (temporal) networks with the DynaWAVE
method. Network alignment aims to find a mapping between networks that
conserves similar regions between the networks. Dynamic (or temporal)
networks are networks whose interactions are time dependent. DynaWAVE
aligns two dynamic networks while taking temporal information into
account. An implementation of the WAVE method, which aligns two static
networks is also available.
